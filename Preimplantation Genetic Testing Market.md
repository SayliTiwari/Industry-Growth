**Preimplantation Genetic Testing Market Trends, and Industrial Segmentation**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on “[Preimplantation Genetic Testing](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/preimplantation-genetic-testing-market/4793) Market: Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035” delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global preimplantation genetic testing market in terms of market segmentation by technology, application, procedure type, products & services, end user and by region. 

**Increasing Use of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) to Promote Global Market Share of Preimplantation Genetic Testing**

A high success rate and relative affordability have made In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) increasingly popular in recent years, resulting in a growth in the global preimplantation genetic testing market.** IVF is a medical procedure that helps couples who are struggling to conceive a child. It involves fertilizing an egg outside the body and implanting it into the uterus. PGT involves taking a small sample of cells from the embryo and testing them for genetic abnormalities. This helps to ensure that only healthy embryos are implanted in the uterus, greatly increasing the chances of a successful pregnancy. A recent study estimates that nearly 400 million people will be living from IVF and other fertility treatments by 2100.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global preimplantation genetic testing market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- An increase in the number of women of reproductive age
- Rising incidence of congenital genetic diseases

**Challenges:**

Preimplantation genetic testing is expected to face a moral stigma that will hamper its global market size. Many people are concerned about the ethical implications of such testing and the potential of it being used to create ‘designer babies’. This has caused a backlash against the technology from many religious and social groups, which could limit its potential market size. Additionally, many people are concerned about the potential misuse of the technology, such as selecting for or against specific genetic traits. This could lead to further ethical issues and limit the market potential.

By procedure type, the market for preimplantation genetic testing can be segmented into preimplantation genetic diagnosis and preimplantation genetic screening. A significant CAGR is predicted for the preimplantation genetic diagnosis segment between now and 2035 to gain the highest revenue. The growth of this segment can be attributed to preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which has been highly successful for high-risk couples with known genetic conditions. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a type of genetic testing that can be done during in vitro fertilization (IVF). It tests the genetic material of the embryo for any potential genetic diseases or abnormalities, allowing couples to make an informed decision about whether or not to pursue a pregnancy. 

North America is projected to generate the highest revenue by 2035 in the preimplantation genetic testing market. The growth is believed to be driven by the increasing number of infertility cases in the region along with the increasing use of PGT for fertility treatments. Statistically, in 2023, the Canadian fertility rate is expected to be around 1.484 births per woman, a decrease of approximately 0.54% from 2022. PGT helps couples who are at risk of passing genetic diseases to their children. As the number of infertility cases increases, more couples are turning to PGT to reduce the risk of their children inheriting genetic disorders. Moreover, the increasing access to advanced healthcare infrastructure in the region and the availability of favorable government initiatives, such as subsidies and tax credits, to promote the use of PGT is also expected to contribute to the growth of the market in the region.
