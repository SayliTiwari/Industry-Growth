**Increasing Generation of Healthcare Data to Promote Global Market Share of Healthcare Quality Management**

The rising generation of healthcare data is one of the major growth factors in the market. Unstructured data is abundant; this data is useful to the healthcare system; therefore, it is critical to employ healthcare quality management to format this data. Physician order data, dictation notes, free text data, and nursing notes are examples of unstructured data. Currently, approximately 80% of global healthcare data is unstructured. Furthermore, the prevalence of chronic disease has increased visits to hospitals and admissions.  Disease management programs aim to improve the health of persons with chronic illnesses while lowering associated costs. Based on the World Health Organization statistics, around 17 million individuals per year die from an NCD before the age of 70. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) kill 41 million people each year, accounting for 74% of all deaths globally. 

Besides this, the market growth is also attributed to the rising cases of medical errors due to which the demand for healthcare quality management becomes imperative. Medical errors are a serious threat to patient safety and a public health issue. Effective healthcare quality management is critical to reducing the occurrence of medical errors. Medical errors cost the United States USD 20 billion each year. Almost 100,000 people die each year as a result of medical errors in hospitals and clinics.
