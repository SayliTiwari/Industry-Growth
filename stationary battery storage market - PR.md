Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global stationary battery storage** market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Advancements in Digital Technologies
- Lower Costs and Advancements in Battery Technology

**Challenges:**

Proper battery care and cleaning are crucial elements. When cleaning batteries, there are certain safety precautions that must be taken. If not done carefully, these precautions can potentially be hazardous. Thus, each of these problems has an effect on the stationary battery storage industry. Despite their growing range of applications, energy storage devices with stationary batteries have been associated with brain and renal harm. The public's knowledge of these health issues may, in part, create obstacles to the industry's progress.

By battery, the global stationary battery storage** market is segmented into lithium ion, sodium sulphur, lead acid and flow battery. The flow battery segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The segment is expanding as a result of increased attention being paid to the advancement of redox flow batteries. These energy-storage devices don't damage the environment and offer excellent power density, energy, lifespan, and efficiency at a lower cost of storage. Because of these qualities, flow batteries are being used by an increasing variety of end-user industries. The flow battery market is anticipated to grow over the course of the study period due to the lengthy service life of these batteries and their growing use in long-duration energy storage applications such as renewable power systems. Over the past ten years, installed renewable energy generation and capacity have been rising steadily worldwide. In 2021, the installed capacity of renewable energy worldwide grew by more than 9.1%, reaching 3063.93 GW. It is crucial to store energy for periods when demand is high since renewable energy sources like solar and wind provide power at different times and in varied amounts.
