The market for portable generators is also anticipated to be impacted by a variety of factors, including rising investments in alternative energy sources and rising consumer awareness of the value of preparedness for emergencies. By 2021, it is anticipated that existing faults and new problems with the electrical supply would result in catastrophic blackouts that will affect at least 350 million people or more than 4% of the world's population.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global portable generator** market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Ageing infrastructure of electricity grid 
- Rising Awareness of Global Warming

**Challenges:**

Carbon monoxide (CO), a dangerous gas, is released by portable generators (PG). CO is a colourless, odourless, invisible gas with an immediate fatality. In addition to killing hundreds of people each year, it sickens countless additional people. Even with windows and doors open, they cannot be utilized inside homes or garages due to substantial carbon monoxide emissions. As a result, it is projected that the risk to human health will prevent the portable generator industry from growing. Generators and generators with short running times are frequently associated with loud noises are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of portable generators.

By application, the global portable generator** market is segmented into emergency and prime/continuous. The emergency segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The tendency towards lengthier power outages, which was followed by an increase in portable generators' operational capabilities, can be attributed to the segment's growth. Emergency portable generators are generally used when severe weather, such as heat waves, storms, and torrential rains, damages the distribution system and transmission. For instance, an unidentified grid breakdown caused a significant power outage in Bangladesh in 2022. Bangladesh experienced the largest blackout in history, which affected 140 million people.
