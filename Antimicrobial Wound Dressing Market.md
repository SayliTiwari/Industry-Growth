` `**Rising Prevalence of Wounds to Drive the Demand for Antimicrobial Wound Dressings**

In the year 2018, around 8.2 million people had wounds with or without infections, according to an article published in the US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, titled “Advances in Wound Care”.

Increasing number of surgeries globally is also contributing to the rising number of surgical wounds, which in turn is raising the need for the deployment of wound dressing for lowering the spread of the infection. Antimicrobial wound dressings, which are known to limit the spread of microbial infections in wound owing to the presence of antiseptic agents in it, help significantly to prevent infection in patients who are at an increased risk of wound infections. On the other hand, with the rising number of diabetes patients worldwide, and the growing concern for the increasing number of diabetic foot ulcers, antimicrobial wound dressings are preferred significantly by healthcare specialists in hospitals and clinics, which in turn is anticipated to drive the growth of the global antimicrobial wound dressing market during the forecast period.
