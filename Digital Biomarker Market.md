**Digital Biomarker Market Set to Surpass $83.8 Billion by 2035**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on “[Digital Biomarker Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/digital-biomarker-market/3217): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035” delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global digital biomarker market in terms of market segmentation by component, therapeutic area, application, end user, and by region. 

**Government Initiatives to Boost Medical Technology to Promote Global Market Share of Digital Biomarker**

The global digital biomarker market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the greater government initiatives, rising demand for sophisticated medical technology, internet penetration, and other factors. The world's millennial population is growing, and rates of sleep problems and neurodegenerative disorders are rising due to increased stress levels among the region's working professionals. Almost one-third of Millennials blame their lack of sleep for worrying about all the things they need to do or do not get done. Besides this, rising patient knowledge of diagnosis and rising disposable wealth are driving a rapid increase in the use of digital biomarkers by laboratories. Moreover, there has been a fast increase in the number of standalone biopharmaceutical firms and diagnostic laboratories that are providing full biomarker solutions.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global digital biomarker market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Advancement in Medical Technology
- Rising Need for Digital Drug Delivery

**Challenges:**

Cyber-attacks have previously been documented to expose patients to privacy breaches and safety issues, which has a substantial impact on the adoption rate of digital biomarkers. Most healthcare organizations that use digital biomarkers are currently governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). However, HIPAA is not relevant when patients interact personally with these technologies. Furthermore, networked software products are constantly vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, which are the most common risks in the market.

By therapeutic area, the global digital biomarker market is segmented into cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, sleep and movement diseases, chronic pain, gastrointestinal diseases, diabetes, respiratory conditions. The neurogenerative disorder segment is to garner a highest revenue of USD 83.8 billion by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The rising effort by companies to use biomarkers for conducting the study of specific treatments is driving the growth of the segment. In 2021, nQ Medical, a US-based startup, presented its first findings from its COBRE Phase II proof-of-concept (PoC) research. The study's goal was to determine cognitive impairment in mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In the course of the assessment process, the company used a digital biomarker called nQi cog and its own technology platform called neuroQWERTY (nQ).
