To ensure performance and hours of service in transportation, the usage of car electronic logging devices is increasing. The need for safety, security, and tracking is essential given how quickly the transportation sector is growing. In the transportation sector, numerous vehicles are employed for fulfillment. Electronic logging systems for automobiles are becoming more widespread to monitor the effectiveness and quantity of service hours in the transportation industry. For instance, the American company Automotive Logistics tested a brand-new electronic logging system for use in vehicles. Along with GPS coordinates and information about driver and vehicle performance, this gadget also keeps track of hours of service.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of global electronic logging devices are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increased investment in the development of driver safety systems.
- Rising demand in Automation 

**Challenges:**

High cost of integration, difficulties in integration, and compromise in privacy are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of Electronic logging devices. 

By component, the global electronic logging devices, the telematics unit is estimated to be the largest segment of the electronic logging device market. The only essential component of any electronic logging device, the telematics unit, is the standard fitment in these devices. A system fitted in a car called a telematics unit monitors both the driver and the vehicle's performance. It enables functions including figuring out the driver's hours of duty, keeping track of the vehicle's condition, fuel efficiency, and tax report, and communicating data via a GSM module.

By region, North America is anticipated to hold the dominant market share, accounting for ~32%. The region has a well-established automotive sector and the presence of key electronic logging device providers and manufacturers in the region. This is caused by the sharp rise in demand for electronic logging devices (ELDs) for a variety of end-user applications, including lower insurance rates, improved route management, and location tracking, among others.

Further, the European market for electronic logging devices is also expected to grow over the forecast period. The region is expected to offer lucrative opportunities for leading market players owing to stringent regulations in Europe. The provision of vehicles outfitted with electronic logging systems by European automotive original equipment manufacturers will significantly boost the growth of the European electronic logging system device business in the upcoming years.
