**Super Absorbent Polymers Market All Set to Rise to USD 34 Billion at 9% CAGR**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on “[Super Absorbent Polymers Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/super-absorbent-polymers-market/4780): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global super absorbent polymers market in terms of market segmentation by type, application, and by region. 

**Increasing Demand for Personal Hygiene Products to Promote Global Market Share of Super Absorbent Polymers**

One factor fueling the market's expansion can be attributed to rising meat and egg exports. Super absorbent polymers are used in the packaging of meat and eggs. For the first eleven months of 2022, there were approximately 5 million tonnes and USD 14 billion worth of pig meat exports to Europe. A further 2 million tonnes of beef and veal carcasses weight equivalent (CWE) were exported from India in 2022. In terms of production numbers, it is anticipated that there will be two million tonnes of CWEs for beef and veal in 2023, with India ranking third in the world.

In addition to these factors, there is an increase in demand for personal hygiene products, which is thought to be a driver in the market expansion of super absorbent polymers. Super absorbent polymers are materials that have a water absorption capacity greater than 300 times their own weight. So, after consumption, great material for a variety of products such sanitary blankets and liners, incontinence or baby diapers, and baby's nappy is retained.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global super absorbent polymers** market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Usage of Baby and Adult Diapers
- Rising Production of Agriculture Products Worldwide

**Challenges:**

Acrylic acid, which is itself generated from propylene, is the primary raw material utilized to create extremely absorbent polymers. Because propylene is derived from petroleum and other natural sources, its price is continually fluctuating, which means that the cost of raw materials may also be affected by the cost of finished goods. Radicals go through soil to the food chain, which has a negative impact on the environment and limits the growth of the SAP market being some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of super absorbent polymers.

By application, the global super absorbent polymers** market is segmented into hygienic and non-hygienic. The hygienic segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Diapers, adult incontinence supplies, and other sanitary products make up the next category. Growth in this market could be attributed to a rise in the number of women who have their periods, which raises the demand for sanitary napkins. 350 million women, or nearly 24% of the world's population, will experience menstruation in 2019. The number of pads or tampons used daily may reach two billion if everyone switches to disposables.

By region, the North America super absorbent polymers** market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. The market's expansion can be largely ascribed to the increased usage of menstruation products and the increase in the proportion of women who are menstruating.  There are roughly 18 million women in the UK who are menstruating. In 2020, 2 million women are anticipated to use at least 25 sanitary towels each month.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global super absorbent polymers** market which includes company profiling of BASF SE, LG Chemicals Ltd., Yixing Danson Technology Co., Zhejiang Weilong Polymer Material Co., Ltd., Sinofloc Chemicals Ltd., Wanhua Chemical Group Co., Ltd, Formosa Plastic Corporation, SNF Limited, Songwon Industrial Co. Ltd., and others.
