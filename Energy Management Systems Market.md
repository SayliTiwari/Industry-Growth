**Increasing Utilization of Renewable Energy to Promote Global Market Share of Global Energy Management Systems**

The global energy management systems market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the growing use of renewable energy sources. According to the findings of the Energy Information Administration, renewable energy sources accounted for around 12.4% of total primary energy consumption in the United States in the year 2021. With a global shift towards renewable sources owing to environmental concerns there is a surge in the demand for energy management systems as these solutions reduce energy costs and increase productivity. The increasing employment of this system by commercial, industrial, and public sector organizations to manage their energy consumption, and reduce costs is further anticipated to propel the energy management system market over the projected period.

By type, the global energy management systems market is segmented into building, home, and industrial energy management systems. The home segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the segment is backed by the increasing adoption of digital technologies along with a growing number of smart homes globally that are equipped with energy management systems. As per recent data, it is predicted that more than 400 million smart homes will exist around the globe by the end of the year 2025. Smart homes help reduce energy consumption for applications such as air conditioning, and other lighting purposes, as well as improve efficiency with the adoption of many smart sensor technologies. All such factors are predicted to boost the growth of the segment in the upcoming years. 

By region, the North American energy management systems market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated owing to the rising investment in sustainable energy in the region especially in the U.S. with changing energy regulations. For instance, it is observed that public benefit funds (PBF) for renewable energy are set up and used by the states in the USA to invest in clean energy supply for the public. In addition to this, the increasing acceptance and utilization of renewable energy among the countries in the North American region together with increasing investment in advanced energy management systems by several industry giants to reduce energy wastage is further estimated to support the market growth. According to the data of 2019 released by the OECD, 8% of the total primary energy consumed in the United States was derived from renewable energy sources.
