The global battery energy storage market is estimated to grow owing to the modification and transition in the traditional power generation system, with the introduction of smart meters and grids, along with the need to harness renewable energy. Application of battery energy storage systems in storage of renewable energy, such as, solar and wind energy, is estimated to boost the market growth. Moreover, various advantages of these systems, including, peak shaving, emergency backup, and load shifting, among others, are further foreseen to drive the market growth.

Regionally, the global battery energy storage market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa region. The market in North America region is anticipated to lead the market share during the forecast period, owing to the rising implementation of renewable energy in commercial, as well as, domestic use. Additionally, the adoption of solar energy as a commercial activity in countries, such as, the U.S. is estimated to boost the market growth. The <a name="_hlk69994136"></a>U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) stated that, in 2018, there were more than 2,500 utility scale solar power plants in the U.S. Moreover, awareness among people, along with government initiatives and increasing investment in renewable energy by major market players, is estimated to drive the market growth in the region. 

The market in the Asia Pacific is estimated to the fastest growing market with the highest CAGR over the forecast period. this growth can be attributed to the growing access of electricity in villages and other remote areas, in countries including, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, China, Singapore, and others, backed by the economic development in the region. Moreover, increasing demand for power supply, backed by the exploding population, is estimated to boost the demand for battery energy storage system in the market, generating massive growth opportunities. 

**Transition in the Power Generation Sector likely to boost the Market Growth**

With the advancement in technology, there is an ongoing transition from traditional power generation and distribution, to a modernized, digitalized, and renewable approach for energy generation. It includes government initiatives, such as, adoption of smart grids, optimization of power distribution, and promoting the use of renewable energy. In the year 2019, more than USD 16.5 billion was invested globally in the smart grid infrastructure. Additionally, government subsidy on solar cells, establishment of renewable energy-based power plants, and others, to promote the transition in the power generation sector, is estimated to boost the market growth.  

However, high initial cost of batteries, and disruption in the supply-chain process of the power generation industry are expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of the market over the forecast period.
