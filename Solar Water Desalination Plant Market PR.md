The global** solar water desalination plant market is anticipated to attain a significant CAGR over the forecast period, i.e., 2024 – 2036. The market is branched by application into industrial, commercial, and others, out of which, the industrial segment is anticipated to gain a substantial share in the market over the forecast period on the back of increasing demand for clean water for various industrial purposes, coupled with general shortage of water across the world. Due to water scarcity, industrialists are adopting desalinated waste water for an array of industrial processes.  

The global** solar water desalination plant market is estimated to grow on the back of the growing global water shortage and increasing adoption of desalinated water. According to the report by United Nations (UN), around two-third of the global population currently lives in water scarcity. Over 4 billion people live under water shortage for at least a month every year. As a solution to this shortage, the sea water is being desalinated to make it suitable for consumption. However, the method of desalination can cause severe environmental pollution. To overcome this, solar water desalination plants have been developed, that can solve the water crisis, and are environment friendly. The growing adoption of solar energy is estimated to boost the market growth. 

On the basis of geographical analysis, the global solar water desalination plant market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa region. The market in the North America region is estimated to gain largest market share over the forecast period, owing to the increasing application of desalination of waste water to use it for residential and industrial purposes.

The research is global in nature and covers detailed analysis on the market in North America (U.S., Canada), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Belgium, Netherlands & Luxembourg, NORDIC [Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark], Poland, Turkey, Russia, Rest of Europe), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of Latin America), Asia-Pacific (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Rest of Asia-Pacific), Middle East and Africa (Israel, GCC [Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman], North Africa, South Africa, Rest of Middle East and Africa). In addition, analysis comprising market size, Y-O-Y growth & opportunity analysis, market players’ competitive study, investment opportunities, demand for future outlook etc. has also been covered and displayed in the research report.

**Increasing Water Scarcity Across the Globe to Boost the Market Growth**

According to other report by the UN, 700 million people are advancing towards water scarcity by the end of 2036.

Water scarcity is a global issue, and various technological advancements are being made in this direction to overcome the shortage of water. The growing shortage of water across the world and increasing innovation with solar technology are the major drivers for the market growth.

However, the negative effects of desalination on water bodies are expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of the global solar water desalination plant market over the forecast period.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global solar water desalination plant market which includes company profiling of Trunz <a name="_hlk82185706"></a>Water Systems AG, Solar Water Solutions Oy, and Elemental Water Makers B.V., and others. However, companies, such as, Tesla Inc., are estimated to invest in this technology. The market is also open for new players and is assessed to provide major growth opportunities in the upcoming years. The profiling enfolds key information of the companies which encompasses business overview, products and services, key financials and recent news and developments. On the whole, the report depicts detailed overview of the global solar water desalination plant market that will help industry consultants, equipment manufacturers, existing players searching for expansion opportunities, new players searching possibilities and other stakeholders to align their market centric strategies according to the ongoing and expected trends in the future.
