**Growing Struct Emission Regulations to Promote Global Market Share of Solar Pontoon**

The global solar pontoon market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased strict emission regulations. Fuel-powered boats are gradually being replaced by electric and solar-powered boats due to government regulations limiting carbon emissions and rising environmental awareness. Boats that are conventional or traditional generate a lot of exhaust gasses, such as CO2, sulfur oxide, and nitrogen oxide. There has been more focus on lowering emissions from boats and ships because cargo ships are one of the major causes of pollution in seaports. Additionally, during the forecast period, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and other organizations will likely enact a number of laws aimed at reducing emissions, which will encourage the use of electric and solar-powered boats.
