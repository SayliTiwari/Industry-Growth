**An Increase In The Prevalence Of Chronic Wounds to Promote Global Market Share of Wound Care**

A growing number of chronic wound sufferers coupled with the need for wound care products are expected to drive the global wound care market to grow significantly. With an aging population and an increasing incidence of chronic diseases like diabetes, there is an increasing demand for wound care products. Diabetes-related foot ulcers and pressure ulcers are becoming increasingly common. Approximately 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, and about 20% of them develop diabetic foot ulcers. A hospital setting is also estimated to have between 10% and 18% prevalence of pressure ulcers. In addition, technological advancements in wound care products, such as new formulations and delivery systems, are making them more effective and accessible, which is driving the growth of the market.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global wound care market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising demand for home healthcare products as a result of the self-medication trend
- Development of advanced wound dressing technologies such as bioactive dressings and pressure mapping

**Challenges:**

Lack of reimbursement and rising medical costs are some of the major factors predicted to hamper the global wound care market. Medical costs are rising, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for hospitals and other medical institutions to cover the costs of wound care. Additionally, many health insurance providers are not reimbursing hospitals and other medical institutions for the costs of wound care, which further hinders the global market size of wound care.

In terms of functions, the global wound care market can be divided into hospitals, specialty clinics, and home healthcare.  Over the forecast period, hospitals are expected to generate a significant share of revenue by the end of 2035. This segment has experienced rapid growth due to the large number of patients requiring advanced wound care and being hospitalized for diabetes and pressure ulcer treatment. With an increase in hospital surgeries, the number of patients requiring wound care has increased. Moreover, hospitals are better equipped to provide advanced wound care treatments, such as skin grafts, which require specialized equipment and trained personnel.

The North American wound care market is expected to generate the highest revenues by 2035. The growth is attributed to the increasing geriatric population, increasing demand for advanced wound care products, and the increasing number of surgeries across the region. The aging population in North America requires more medical care and often requires wound care treatments following surgeries. This increases the demand for advanced wound care products, such as antimicrobial dressings, negative pressure wound therapy, and advanced wound closure devices, which will drive up revenues in the North American market. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of chronic wounds and the rising awareness of advanced wound care products are expected to fuel the demand for wound care products in the region.
