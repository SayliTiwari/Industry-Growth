Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global radiation-hardened electronic Market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising Demand for Satellites
- Surging Space Industry Radiation

**Challenges:**

One of the main reasons that are expected to slow market growth is the large cost and complexity involved in designing radiation-resistant electronics. In particular, electronics that have been subjected to radiation damage must be designed in such a way as to withstand the hostile environment of outer space. The need to perform rigorous tests and validations makes the design process costlier. Moreover, more expensive materials and components are often required in the case of radiation-hardened devices compared with conventional electronics. 

The biggest market share is estimated to be obtained by the aerospace and defense sector, at 40 % over the projected period. Increasing investment by governments around the world is a major factor behind this segment's growth. In highly ionizing environments such as space, upper altitudes and nuclear installations the aerospace and defense sectors are very active. There is a potential for radiation to interrupt or harm electronic systems in such an environment, which may lead to missions.

North America market is anticipated to garner a notable growth of 33 % in the market, the growth of the market can be attributed majorly to the increasing space industry in the region. The increasing investment in space exploration has resulted in growing demand for radiation-hardened electronics in the region which is driving the market growth.
